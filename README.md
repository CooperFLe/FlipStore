# T-minus Payday
Hacktober 2017 Project

# Problem:
With student organizations, it takes a lot of emails back and forth and multiple weeks in order to get reimbursed for supplies. I'm sure many college kids know that a lot of us just can't afford to be missing cash for that long. Even if it is $5.

With T-minus Payday, we hope to expedite this process by putting all of the relevant information right in front of your treasurer. All the treasurer has to do is click approve to accept your reimburse you through your prefered method (PayPal, Venmo, ACH transfer, etc.).

# The Team:
## Cooper Le - Lead Developer
## Joey Hamed - Lead Designer
## James Costian - He was here. For like 30 minutes.

# The Tech:
Built on AWS
- S2 for image storage
- RDS as the backend server
- Lambda functions to make requests

Loved by JavaScript
- Electron
- Node.js
- Others we imported then may or may not have used

# The Apology:
Sorry, our web dev got sick and had to leave (James Costian). Please enjoy my (Cooper Le) first effort at web development that doesn't make me want to claw my eyes out! It isn't horrible, but it ain't good. 

It's okay, it is the guts that matter ;)
